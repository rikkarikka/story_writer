car sickness	when i was young , my family and i traveled a lot by car . i loved looking outside and discovering new landscapes . but no matter what , i always ended up being sick . my father would have to pull over and i would go out . when i came back in , i could n't enjoy the trip anymore .
first shower	we got a new kitten named marie . i spent the first day bonding with her and loving on her . when i took a shower she meowed and meowed outside the shower door . i cut my shower short to make her feel better . the next shower i set up a camera to film but she was over it .
